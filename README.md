# Text Clustering on E-Commerce Dataset using Unsupervised Machine Learning

The project will show how to perform clustering on Product Description and Review  clustering using Machine Learning algorithms to find the similarities in the clusters in which the  product descriptions and reviews have been grouped. 

A retail industry generates a large amount of textual data from various sources including product description reviews. The dataset used will initially consist of only two columns which are the “category” which is the product category, and “description” that is the product description and its reviews by users. Originally, there are four types of product categories from the dataset that were described and reviewed, of which the products are from the “Household”, “Books”, “Electronics”, and “Clothing & Accessories” category.

The purpose of this project is to categorize after identifying distinct product categories within the product descriptions and reviews text data. Mainly, this data consists of one column that is named as “label” which consists of four main categories; Household, Books, Electronics, Clothing & Accessories. However, after we discover the text data that has been clustered by three different algorithms, there might be new product categories that are not in the existing label. So, we want to discover if there are any new product categories.
